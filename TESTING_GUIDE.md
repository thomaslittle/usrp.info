- Side-by-side comparison opens
- Changes are highlighted with colors
- Field-by-field breakdown shows differences
- Author context is displayed for both versions

### 5. **Restoring Previous Version**

   - Changes summary: "Final updates"
2. Save the changes
3. Go to version history
4. Click restore on version 2
5. Confirm the restoration

**Expected Result:**
- New version (v4) is created with content from v2
- Content is restored successfully
- All version history is preserved
- New version has proper change summary indicating restoration

### 6. **Permission Testing**

**Steps:**
1. Test with different user roles (if available):
   - Viewer: Should not see version history
   - Editor: Should see version history for their department
   - Admin: Should see version history for their department
   - Super Admin: Should see all version history

**Expected Result:**
- Permissions are enforced correctly
- Unauthorized users get proper error messages

## üîç What to Look For
